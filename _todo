To do:

Before initial release
* cache comment count
* add GA support, including what is clicked, expanded etc
* show images in front page for posts that have them
* make post-page tags tab-like i.e. show active tag posts below all tags

Possible future improvements:
* add URL state about tag expand-state	
* make diamond graphics more crisp
* Use Compass for instead of manually CSS property prefixing
* sanity check in IE8
* add "software engineer + interaction design" to logo somewhere
* add build instructions
* add build scripts, e.g. to autosuffix proper files with md5 hash
* add background to logo
* make navbar stay on top on mobile when scrolled down
* Animate the faded line when blog post expands, and the 'Collapse' to 'Expand' animation
* add noscript-variants of lazyloaded imgs
