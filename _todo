To do:

Before initial release
* add GA support, including what is clicked, expanded etc
* setup Cache-Control
* mention that this is not a GIMP blog anymore
* ensure events are part of page navigation in GA

Possible future improvements:
* make post-page tags tab-like i.e. show active tag posts list below all tags
* when clicking logo, expose a https://setofskills.com/ link
* add URL state about tag expand-state	
* make diamond graphics more crisp
* Use Compass for instead of manually CSS property prefixing
* sanity check in IE8
* add "software engineer + interaction design" to logo somewhere
* add build instructions
* add build scripts for e.g. main-built-*.js
* add noscript-variants of lazyloaded imgs
