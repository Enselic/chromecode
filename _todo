To do:

Before initial release
* suffix js with version so a fresh HTML page results in matching js
* add effects to navbar button (css3 anims)
* add Discuss comment system
* import comments
* make right margin nice and straight
* layout individual posts pages
* add GA support, including what is clicked, expanded etc
* Write blog post

Possible future improvements:
* Use Compass for instead of manually CSS property prefixing
* sanity check in IE8
* add "software engineer + interaction design" to logo somewhere
* add build instructions
* add background to logo
* make navbar stay on top on mobile when scrolled down
* Animate the faded line when blog post expands, and the 'Collapse' to 'Expand' animation
* add noscript-variants of lazyloaded imgs
