<p>Welcome to my new site; both the new domain name <strong><i>setofskills.com</i></strong> and the new layout. So why change domain? To remove the accidental Google Chrome association <strong><i>chromecode.com</i></strong> got (which I registered 5 years before Google Chrome was released by the way). Since my old site was starting to feel a bit dead due to it being more than 4 years since my last blog post I thought now would be a good time to do this. All blog posts have been ported to the new site though.<p>

<p>So why change layout? Partly to freshen it up, partly to learn new things. You see, my old site had the blog hosted by Blogger, and the rest on a cheap Danish web host. The new site is hosted in the Amazon cloud and is built on fresh(er) front-end technology such as SCSS, CSS3 animations, Bootstrap, Jekyll and RequireJS. The color scheme is inspired by my new main editor Sublime Text. So long Emacs, and thanks (not) for all the <strike>fish</strike> Lisp.</p>

<p>You might also have noted that <strong><i>tasktaste.com</i></strong> has been taken offline (and taken over by some SEO company). Its usage was pretty low, and keeping it alive was not worth it. I might resurrect it someday, but then it will be hosted on this domain rather than having a domain on its own.</p>

<p>As for time over for coding, it is still low. I now have two kids to raise. Occasiaonlly I get some code written though, so keep your eyes open for announcements in 1-10 years.
