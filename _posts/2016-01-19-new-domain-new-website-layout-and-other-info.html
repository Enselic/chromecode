This post will be much longer once I'm done with the new site. So, I have decided to change domain from chromecode.com to setofskills.com. More info to follow. I'm right now doing the new site. This publishing is just a test publishin so to speak. Yoda, yoda and yoda. Star wars. Used: SCSS, Amazon Cloud, jQuery (of course), Bootstrap for responsive grid system. Disquss for comments. Static website. New stuff will be moved to subfolders. What happened to tasktaste? What happened in life? Jekyll for static site generation. Supports no-js and no-css. CSS3 animations. Color scheme inspired by Sublime Text 2, which I have replaced Emacs with. I will continue to improve the site without any new blog posts. RequireJs. More?
