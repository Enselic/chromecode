<h2>About</h2>
<p>
	This is the personal website of Martin "Enselic" Nordholts.
	It contains my blog and some other information related to me and what I do.
	In my spare time I mostly raise my kids. If I get some time over I enjoy creating
	and contributing to open source software, often with a focus on interaction design and usability.

<h2>Contact</h2>

	feedback. Please send mails
	to <i>my_nickname_described_above</i> at gmail dot com. I
	check my mail regularily.
